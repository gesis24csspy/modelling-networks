# Modelling Networks

This content is ready to go! Create a CodeSpace as usual. The virutal environment *should* be selected by default this time, so try running the code right away. 😎

Note that some cells in the Enron notebook will take some time to run. (Especially Models 3-4.) Some plotting commands will also be a bit slow, but we should be able to run things in the live session together without issue.

See you in class!
